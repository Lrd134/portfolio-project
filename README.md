## Gaming Decoded
  The brand that I am going to create will be around explaining programming to others,
  the way that I intend to do this is through video games. It is quite a dramatic effect when you're programming
  and the game that you get to play afterwards is one that you have worked on and/or created yourself.
  I believe that through careful explanation, community, and enjoyment anyone could learn to code.
  Video Games are for everyone, whether or not you would admit it, I'm sure you've played Candy Crush or some variation.
  Lot's of our daily time killers were programmed by someone, someone that never understood what a computer was.
  It took a lot of time, sweat, and tears for them to develop the programs we know and love today.
  The goal of Gaming Decoded is to remove some of the sweat and tears, this will be done through many videos and
  the forums I intend to create on the website.
